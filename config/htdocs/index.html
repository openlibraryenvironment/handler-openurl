<title>The ReShare OpenURL resolver</title>
<h1>The ReShare OpenURL resolver</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  This resolver is part of
  <a href="http://projectreshare.org/">Project ReShare</a>,
  a fully open, community-led initiative to an develop interoperable resource-sharing platform that any library can use irrespective of its choice of ILS. Note that it is <b>in development</b> and has a long way to go.
</p>
<p>
  The resolver accepts OpenURL requests and converts them into ReShare requests which it pushes into an instance of
  <a href="https://github.com/openlibraryenvironment/mod-rs/">mod-rs</a>
  running within
  <a href="https://dev.folio.org/">the FOLIO platform</a>.
  Consequently, the outcome of making a request to it is not a link to an immediately available electronic copy of the nominated resource, but that an ILL request to a suitable library is initiated.
</p>
<p>
  As a result, to the untrained eye, the pages that display on submitting an OpenURL are low on information. But
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pR6z-gm5_cY">to the eye that has brains</a>, they are letting the user know that work is under way to supply the resource.
</p>
<p>
  Note that the result pages, like this page, are deliberately spartan. Styling will come later in the project.
